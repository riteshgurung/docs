{"name":"API Guidelines","tagline":"","body":"***\r\n\r\n> ## How to use this document?\r\n> 1. Go through the document before you plan to develop API for your application.\r\n> 1. Plan your implementation.\r\n> 1. Read the document again. See if you comply with this doc as much possible.\r\n> 1. Develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why is API Design Important?\r\n* Bad APIs result in unending stream of support calls\r\n* Public APIs are “forever” - one chance to get it right\r\n\r\n### Characteristics of a Good API\r\n* Easy to learn\r\n* Easy to use, even without documentation\r\n* Hard to misuse\r\n* Easy to read and maintain code that uses it\r\n* Sufficiently powerful to satisfy requirements\r\n* Easy to extend\r\n* Scope of arguments\r\n* No duplication\r\n* Generalized\r\n* Versioned\r\n\r\n### The Process of API Design\r\n* Gather Requirements–with a healthy degree of skepticism (try writing user stories)\r\n* Do not please everyone. Aim to displease everyone equally. Do not play with too many good-to-haves.\r\n* Count the number of API calls planned initially. Try if they can be further reduced. Re-iterate until possibility exist.\r\n* List down all the API call urls and verify if all user stories/requirement is met before commencing development.\r\n\r\n### General Principles\r\n* API should satisfy its requirements\r\n* API Should Do One Thing and Do it Well\r\n* Functionality should be easy to explain\r\n* If it's hard to name, that's generally a bad sign\r\n* You can always add, but you can never remove\r\n* Application development and maintenance should not Impact existing API\r\n* Names Matter–API is a Little Language. Be consistent–same word means same thing throughout API\r\n* Strive for symmetry\r\n* Document: Reuse is something that is far easier to say than to do. Doing it requires both good design and very good documentation\r\n* Return failure message upon failed request\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heavily inspired by http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
